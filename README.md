## **Announcing AI Ghauri GUI — Supercharge Your Ghauri Workflow**​[](https://htdark.com/threads/ai-ghauri-gui-by-deepest.136134/#-announcing-ai-ghauri-gui--supercharge-your-ghauri-workflow "Permanent link")

  
  
Ghauri has earned its place as a go-to SQL injection engine: fast, flexible, and battle-tested on real-world targets. Today, we’re leveling it up with  **AI Ghauri GUI**  — a sleek, cross-platform desktop app that keeps Ghauri’s raw power while adding an intelligent, streamlined experience on top.  
  
  

### Why this matters​[](https://htdark.com/threads/ai-ghauri-gui-by-deepest.136134/#-why-this-matters "Permanent link")

  
Command lines are great—until they aren’t. Complex flags, long logs, and repetitive trial-and-error can slow down even seasoned testers.  **AI Ghauri GUI**  reduces friction, automates “what should I try next?”, and helps you move from signal to decision faster.  
  
  

### What’s inside​[](https://htdark.com/threads/ai-ghauri-gui-by-deepest.136134/#-whats-inside "Permanent link")

  

-   **AI-assisted tuning (Ollama or OpenAI-compatible)**  
    Read the live log and get  **smart next-step suggestions**  (timeouts, WAF hints, techniques, DBMS fingerprints, etc.). Apply with one click. Use local models via  **Ollama**  for privacy, or plug any  **OpenAI-compatible**  API for cloud models.
-   **Clean, modern UI for the full Ghauri feature set**  
    Every switch, flag, and technique—without losing CLI fidelity. Batch, sessions, detection strings, injection parameters, enumeration targets—**all first-class**.
-   **Presets with metadata**  
    Save/load configs as JSON with name, description, and author. Perfect for team sharing, reproducibility, and audits.
-   **Artifact harvesting & one-click export**  
    Automatically collects logs, target.txt, sessions (.sqlite), and bundles them into  **JSON**  or a  **ZIP**  (with meta.json, logs, and command replay). Great for reporting and handoffs.
-   **Dedicated Logs window**  
    Keep scanning on one side while you deep-dive on output in a separate, resizable view.
-   **Auto-respond mode**  
    Avoid stalls when tools prompt for choices (e.g., multiple injection points). The GUI can auto-select sane defaults to keep runs moving.
-   **No vendor lock-in**  
    It’s still Ghauri under the hood. Prefer the terminal? Export the exact command string from the GUI and run it anywhere.
-   **Privacy by design**  
    Run  **LLMs locally**  via Ollama, or switch to cloud only when you choose. Your workflow, your control.
-   **Cross-platform & lightweight**  
    Works on Windows,  macOS, and Linux. Minimal dependencies. Designed for speed.

  

### Who it’s for​[](https://htdark.com/threads/ai-ghauri-gui-by-deepest.136134/#-who-its-for "Permanent link")

  

-   **Red teams & pentesters**  who want faster iteration and cleaner handoffs.
-   **AppSec & blue teams**  validating fixes and documenting findings.
-   **Learners**  who want an easier on-ramp to Ghauri without sacrificing capability.

  

### Get started in minutes​[](https://htdark.com/threads/ai-ghauri-gui-by-deepest.136134/#-get-started-in-minutes "Permanent link")

  

1.  Install Ghauri (CLI) and run the app.
2.  Set your target (URL, raw request, or bulk file).
3.  (Optional) Open  **AI Settings**  → choose  **Ollama**  or  **OpenAI-compatible**, pick a model.
4.  Kick off a scan. Click  **Suggest next config (LLM)**  any time to adapt on the fly.

  
**AI Ghauri GUI**  keeps the spirit of Ghauri—fast, precise, and scriptable—while bringing a thoughtful layer of guidance and ergonomics. Less fiddling, more findings.
